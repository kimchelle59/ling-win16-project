 One night, a little boy, while he was playing with his pet dog, found a 
frog outside. The little boy trapped the frog, but because he was not very 
smart he proceeded to put the frog in a jar without a lid. Because frogs can 
jump, the frog jumped out of the jar while the little boy was sleeping that 
night and hopped away. When the little boy woke up the next morning, he was 
sad to see that the frog was missing, so he got dressed in his little 
explorer outfit and called out the window for the frog. Then his dog, 
because his dog was also not very smart, fell out of the window with the 
glass jar on his head. Even though the little boy was worried about the dog, 
he was mostly just annoyed that the dog had broken the glass jar that he had 
planned to keep the frog in, because again, the little boy was not very 
smart, so he didn’t put two and two together and realize that he needed a 
jar with a lid if he wanted to keep the frog. So the boy and the dog went 
looking for the little frog, calling for it even though frogs don’t 
understand human voices. They looked in a hole and again, because the dog 
was kind of a problem, the dog started playing with a bees’ nest. A bee 
stung the little boy and then the dog knocked the bee nest down and while 
the little boy was looking at a tree the bees chased the dog across the 
woods. While the little boy was looking at a tree, an owl flew out and 
scared him and knocked him down and chased him onto a rock, where he 
proceeded to call for the frog again. However, it was not a tree branch he 
was holding onto to keep his balance on the rock, but because the little boy 
apparently lived in the most animal inhabited forest in the entire world, a 
deer or moose or some sort of four-legged creature with antlers was actually 
what he was holding onto. It picked the boy up and threw him off the side of 
a cliff, because deers are just that smart. Deer are just that smart. The 
boy and his dog fell over the edge of the cliff into a little pond with 
lilies. Recognizing the lily, the boy realized that this was probably where 
the frog was. He and the dog crept over to a log, peeked over the side of it 
and saw a whole family of frogs. This made the boy happy because he was now 
about to steal another frog from the family of frogs and unjustly imprison 
it against its will. He took the frog from its family and waved a cheery 
goodbye to the family of frogs he had just stolen a child from. What the 
heck, the boy stole a frog. I guess the end.

So there’s this boy with his pet dog and his pet frog... who’s in a jar. 
And... they’re in the bedroom, and one day, the frog escapes from his jar, 
and the boy is very dismayed about this fact. And the dog appears to be 
dismayed as well. So, the... boy is searching everywhere; the dog got his 
head stuck in the jar... poor dog. And... so now the dog falls out the 
window because apparently this dog is an idiot. Breaks the jar. And the boy 
is not too happy that he has an idiot for a dog. Um... Th—— this dog and the 
boy are searching for the frog—see, they’re... searching near bumblebees 
and... the boy is getting harassed by various wilderness creatures. And... 
the... hive... the—— the—— the bees were in the other tree and the dog is... 
probably going to get stung, and the boy is in another tree looking for his 
frog, paying no attention to his dog; he’s a very irresponsible dog owner. 
The dog is now getting chased by bees, and the boy fell out of the 
tree—serves him right! And... the boy is now getting chased by an angry owl, 
but he’s just too busy searching for his frog. And... eventually he gets 
caught by a deer, and the deer is sort of... walking with this boy on his 
head, and the dog is running after him... And... Then the deer sort of... 
drops the boy and the dog just sort of goes with him, being the loyal dog he 
is. And they both fall into a... lake of some sort? A very shallow lake. 
Because they haven’t drowned. And, um... now the boy is telling the dog to 
be quiet, and now they’re crawling across a log... and... the boy and dog 
find a whole family of frogs. And so then, the boy, being a horrible person 
as well as an irresponsible dog owner, just takes one of the frogs from the 
family and leaves. And everything’s just supposed to be cool.

Frog story! || Well I mean, it says frog where are you, but... yeah. So 
there’s a little boy, and he has a frog, in a jar, and he has a dog, too. 
The dog’s not in the jar. || So he goes to sleep one night, and he leaves 
the frog in the jar, by the foot of his bed, but... he neglects to close the 
jar, and, the frog escapes || and in the morning the boy’s like || crap, 
where’s my frog? And he looks... in his really tall boots, and he doesn’t 
find it, and... his dog looks in the jar, and the dog gets the jar stuck on 
his head, and... the boy calls out the window, and he doesn't see anything 
|| and then the dog falls out the window and crashes and breaks the jar, and 
the boy just gives him the stink eye || whilst wearing the very large boots 
|| and... the boy and the dog go out into the woods, and they keep calling 
for the frog || and they look around || um... and th— and the boy 
accidentally disrupts a... like, ground— uh, I guess a groundhog’s little, 
uh... little burrow, I guess, and I think gets bit on the nose, and then 
[laughs] the dog accidentally wakes up a beehive || um... and the bees chase 
the two into the for— uh, the dog into the forest || uh, and the boy also, 
nn, disturbs an owl, who also knocks him out of a tree... um... and they go 
into the forest, and... the... boy climbs up onto what he thinks are these 
branches to call for the dog, and then it r— it turns out these are a deer’s 
antlers... and the deer’s like, nah fam || and [laughs] and the... and 
catches the boy onto the antlers, and they run off to this like, small 
little, like, cl— cliff thing, and then th— the deer stops and... the boy 
and the dog fall into a pond || um... but then the boy hears some like, some 
noises, and he looks over... this log... and turns out, um... these two 
frogs, and then a bunch of baby frogs... oh my god, baby frogs! || And... 
um... I, I, I, I would assume that one of these are... is the frog that he 
originally took, but, um... but at any rate he, he’s like, oh, this is a 
frog family! And then, uh, the last picture shows him taking, um... a 
little... one of the little baby frogs with him, to keep I think. Um... 
so... yeah. Oh my god, baby frogs.

Is this number one? || Um, there is a frog that is in a jar, and this boy 
and dog are really curious to get to know it… And the frog looks happy about 
this. || Oh, okay! Um… Wait, no! But the boy and the dog are sleeping and 
the frog is like trying to escape. It’s like slipping out of its little jar, 
and then it’s gone and the boy and the puppy wake up. || And the boy and the 
puppy are looking everywhere for the frog. In a shirt and in the jar and 
stuff and they don’t find it and they’re looking outside the window now. || 
And they’re calling out for the frog like, Frog, where are you! Where did 
you go? || Oh, and the puppy fell out the windo-ow! Oh but the little boy 
rescued the puppy, but he looks really angry about this for some reason. || 
And they’re calling into the woods, like, Fro-og! Where are you? || And then 
they’re searching in a hole and in a, in bee hive? But that’s not where the 
frog is, that’s where a gopher and some bees are. And the boy looks angry. 
|| Oh and they just upset the hive and the hive fell down and the boy is, 
uh, looking in a hole in a tree to see if the frog is there. || Oh no, and 
they’re being chased by the, by the bees! That’s what you get for disturbing 
a bee’s hive anyways. || Oh and they’re also being chased by an owl because 
the boy disturbed the owl’s house, in the tree. But they still don’t know 
where the frog is so they’re like on a boulder, looking, calling out for 
Frog, saying, Frog, where are you? || But they found a deer instead. And uh, 
they’re following—well, the boy is on the deer’s head because, he fell on 
the deer’s head, and they’re looking for the frog. || Oh, and they fall off 
a cliff! Um, into a pond of some sort… I bet that’s where the frog is. || 
Oh, and the boy goes, ker-plook! And the puppy goes ker-plook into the pond. 
But they look… happy about it and he’s holding his hand up to his ear like, 
I hear something! || And the boy’s like, shh, puppy, shh! [background 
singing/music] || Um, and then the boy is going, shh! Puppy! Looking into a 
tree trunk, like a dead tree trunk. And they’re like, flipping on the other 
side of the tree trunk to see if Frog is there. || And, but, damn! There is 
Frog, and Frog, and Frog’s, um… romantic interest, I suppose. || Who-oa! And 
then Puppy and Kid are like super surprised because, surprise! Frog and 
Frog’s romantic interest have baboos. B-Babies. They have babies. || And the 
last one, they’re saying, the boy and the pupper, puppy, are sa-haying 
goodbye to Frog and Frog’s family. Because now that they realized Frog has a 
family they can’t keep Frog captured in a jar. || And that’s the story.

Narrative: "Frog" [Frog_F23_KK.mp3] Transcribed: Kieran Kelley

um... a boy named Billy was sleeping on his bed with // his dog Bob... 
They've-- had captured a frog in a pond nearby and // set the frog in a 
little bowl. 'Cept the frog e-escaped during the night and when... Billy and 
Bob woke up// the frog was gone. Billy started looking everywhere for the 
frog. And // Bob assisted him-- assisted him actively in trying to locate // 
the disappeared animal. They looked through the window and called the frog. 
"Where was the frog?" they kept wondering. Suddenly Billy became suspicious 
and asked bob if he had eaten the frog? Billy-- uh Bob just // licked Billy 
several times and I guess Billy figured out that // that was not where the 
frog was. So they set up-- they set out to walk around // and went back to 
the nearby forest where they had first found the frog. They kept on calling, 
"Frog? Frog where are you?" They looked in the holes // they looked... in 
the bee's house. In the little hole // there indeed was a little animal // 
except it turned out to be a stinking rat. They looked in // the crevices of 
the trees. They even did some damage // to the bee's house as they did so. 
They... everytime-- everywhere they looked an animal came out and // made 
them go away. The frog was nowhere to be found... Billy // climbed up a 
little mo-- a little hill and tried calling the frog. The frog did not 
respond. It was getting dark and they were getting tired and panicked and 
they even got carried away by... a deer // that was passing by... They fell 
in a pond. And then they remembered that they had first // found the frog in 
this pond. And // that // there were actually a lot of frogs in this little 
pond. So they listened quietly for the sound of the frog and they got near-- 
closer to the place where the sounds were coming from... until suddenly // 
they located an entire family of frogs that were indeed living in the pond. 
And... they were really happy to see // frog that looked like the frog they 
had found on the first day. And... after giving it a little bit of // 
thought they decided to get another frog because they all look the same. So 
they picked one and they went away. They had found their frog The end.

This is the story of ‘Frog Where Are You?’. Once upon a time a little boy 
and his pet dog had...a pet frog that he kept in a jar and he absolutely 
loved the frog. And one night while that boy and the dog were sleeping, the 
frog climbed out of the jar and hopped away. And in the morning the boy went 
to go look at his frog and he realized that the frog was gone. And he 
was...At first he started searching in his room, inside his boots, then he 
looks out the window, he’s calling ‘Frog where are you?’, ‘Frog where are 
you?’. But the dog is looking inside the jar and then his head gets stuck in 
the jar. And while the boy is looking out the window, the dog, with his head 
still inside the jar, falls out the window and then the jar smashes on the 
ground. The boy then climbs out the window and picks up his dog and he’s 
very angry because...the dog has scared him and broken the jar. But then he 
decides that they need to keep looking for the frog. And so they go 
searching through the back yard calling ‘Frog where are you?’. || The boy 
looks in a hole, dog looks up at a bee hive, but when the boy looks in a 
hole a gofer pops out and says ‘What are you looking here for. Your frog is 
not here. Go somewhere else.’ The dog is still looking at the beehive. So 
then the boy continues and looks in a hole inside another tree. In the 
mean-time the dog has knocked down the beehive and the bees are very angry. 
|| So while the boy...the boy searches in the whole and then suddenly an owl 
pops out and says ‘Whoo are you? Why are looking for your frog here? Frogs 
don’t live in trees!’ and the dog is being chased by...a bunch of bees and 
runs away from them. The owl continues to...chase the boy until the boy gets 
to a rock. The boy then climbs up on the rock and starts calling again for 
the frog saying “Frog where are you?’, and he holds onto some tree branches 
near the rock...to keep himself steady. The dog quietly comes back after 
having been chased by the bees. But then the branch that the boy was holding 
onto was not a branch, it was...an elk, and the...elk picks the boy up on 
its head between its antlers. And the boy says ‘Put me down, put me down!’, 
and the elk keeps running and running and eventually throws the boy off a 
cliff into the pond. And the dog then jumps down and follows. || ‘Splash’. 
The boy and the dog are in the pond and they are very wet, but then when the 
boy is in the pond, he listens and he can hear a ‘ribbit, ribbit’ sound 
which sounds just like his frog. So the boy tells the dog, ‘Shh, be quiet’ 
and they slowly look behind a big, old log, and there on the other side is 
the boy’s frog with his whole family and lots of baby frogs. || And then the 
mommy and the daddy frog say that they need to stay and take care of all the 
frog babies but that the boy can take one small baby frog back to live with 
him as a pet. And the boy says ‘Thank you frog’, and with his new pet and 
the dog, the boy goes home. The End.

// met an owl... but still couldn't find the frog. um // but at one point // 
he met a reindeer and the reindeer carried him over to a river and threw him

A little boy and his dog are sitting in his bedroom. The dog is obviously 
wanting to get into the glass jar that is holding a frog. And the boy is 
looking indulgently at the dog, but he’s also I think protecting the frog, 
at least at the beginning point. Uh, when the boy goes to sleep the dog is 
sleeping on the boy’s bed and the frog is obviously thinking that this is my 
chance to escape, because the frog didn’t like the look of the dog looking 
into his glass jar (and I understand that). Boy wakes up the next morning 
and the frog is gone. Now there is an uproar in the boy’s bedroom as the 
frog and dog, I’m sorry, boy and dog look for the frog, throwing the room 
apart, looking in boots, the dog now has the bowl stuck on his head, but no 
sign of the frog. Now they’re looking out the window, because he looks like 
he’s calling to the frog maybe the frog will come back. The dog is still 
stuck in the glass bowl, which is very funny, and uh, now the dog is making 
a break for it. He’s running out, whether to catch the frog or just because 
now he’s seen that there is an escape, there’s a way out, I’m not sure. Uh 
the boy, also, is wondering if this is the case, if the dog is making a 
break for it too. He immediately jumps out of the window as well. The glass 
jar has now broken and the boy grabs onto the dog and is now holding him 
very tight. He is not going to get out of his clutches. The boy looks a 
little annoyed with the dog but the dog is sucking up to the boy licking the 
boy. Uh they’re still not giving up on finding the frog, they’ve gone out, 
they’re calling for him. The dog looks like he’s yelling, but I don’t think 
the frog is coming back again. They’re looking in holes, the dog is 
attacking a beehive, maybe the frog is there, it’s really not a good idea. 
Uh a ground hog comes out of one of the holes as if to say, “Beat it, kid, 
I’m not a frog.” The beehive comes down, the bees are now after the dog, all 
this uproar over the frog. And now even an owl is coming to see what is 
going on. They’re still calling for the frog. Uh okay, now a deer has come 
and hooks the boy on the deer’s horns. All this over trying to find a frog. 
The boy and the deer and the dog are now, um, running away. The deer throws 
the boy and the dog into a pond where I have not seen the last panel but I 
am guessing they will find the frog. Nope actually I don’t see the frog, 
they’re in the water, they come out of the water, they’ve managed to 
survive. They’re looking at the log that is in the water (haven’t learned 
their lesson yet), and all of a sudden they see the frog. And the reason the 
frog wanted to escape is because there is a Mrs. Frog, and Frog and Mrs. 
Frog look so happy together that the boy and the dog say goodbye and leave 
them alone and they go home by themselves. Although it looks like actually 
they’ve taken a baby frog with them. Oh yes, I see, there’s a family of 
frogs which I missed the first time and so now the boy and the dog are 
taking one of the frogs and the whole thing will start again no doubt.

This is the story...about a little boy called Tom...and his trusty...friend, 
his little dog called Sally, and what happened one day when he was given a 
frog...to look after. The story begins with Tom at home in his bedroom one 
night, sharing his new...friend...with Sally. He looks very happy and is 
excited for what he will do the following day. He’s going to go out into the 
local garden, into his garden and then properly into fields beyond to see if 
he can find more frogs, so that he can...enjoy them. Unfortunately, he 
doesn’t think to put a lid or a top on the jar and he leaves his window 
open. So when he wakes up in the morning, both he and his dog Sally are 
really quite surprised and alarmed to find that the frog has gone from the 
jar. They look everywhere. Inside the cupboards, under the bed, inside the 
boots...they look outside the window as well, and...Tom begins to call for 
the frog. Sally has stuck her nose so far into the glass jar that she can’t 
get it off, and in her struggles to get the glass jar off her head she falls 
out of the window. Tom is a little upset about this, but happy that he was 
able to find Sally and not lose her as well. || He and Sally set off calling 
beyond the house, into the forest and into the woods beyond. || There is 
a...lot going on in the forest, it is a lovely summer’s day, there’s a 
wasps’ nest hanging from one of the trees, and in his...her excitement, 
Sally jumps up and knocks it off the tree and an angry swarm of...of wasps 
follows her at great speed into the local...surroundings. || Tom doesn’t 
notice now that he’s knocked over by Sally on her way to get away from the 
swarm. He is looking everywhere. He looks inside the holes in the ground and 
disturbs a local...vole, he looks inside a crack inside one of the large old 
tree trunks and disturbs a sleeping owl. The owl is not pleased and...waves 
his wings over the top of Tom. Tom climbed up and climbs down, and he’s busy 
yelling to try and call the frog. He doesn’t realize that one of 
the...branches that 1 he climbs up actually...are the...belong to the head 
of a stag, and before he knows it, he’s being carried off into the distance 
and thrown over the edge into the river. There he lands with a great ‘plop’ 
in the water accompanied by Sally his dog, but to his great delight...when 
he comes up for air, he’s holding...guess what?...a frog. And he can see 
that what’s happened is the frog has found his way back to his own 
family...who are as curious about him, Tom, as Tom is about them. He decides 
he doesn’t want to disturb them and will leave the frog there and let them 
go on their way. He ends up falling over again, into the water...but he’s 
had a great time.

Frog, where are you? || One night a boy and a dog said goodnight to their 
pet frog. || || They went to bed, and fell fast asleep. || When they were 
fast asleep the frog... climbed out of the jar || hopped out of the room || 
and disappeared. The next morning the boy, and the dog woke up, and noticed 
that the jar was empty! || Where was the frog? || || They looked everywhere. 
The boy even looked in the boots. But the dog was convinced that somehow, 
that frog still had to be in that bowl, that jar, where he belonged. He 
stuck his head into the jar || and uh-oh! His head got stuck. || [The] boy 
opened the window and called out, frog, where are you? || The dog looked out 
of the window too || but he had that glass gar on his head, and that glass 
jar was so heavy, and the dog leaned out so far, that he tumbled to the 
ground! || The jar broke. || The boy jumped out of the window, hugged his 
dog, the dog licked him and || well the dog was alright. The boy was a 
little annoyed, though. Did break the glad jar. And they still didn’t know 
where frog was! So they went outside, out into the yard, and out into the 
forest. Yelling, where are you, frog? Where are you, frog? || The dog 
noticed some bees. || And he was wondering, maybe he’s at the beehive. So 
the dog ran to the tree where the bees were and started... looking at the 
beehive. The boy looked at a hole in the ground and called into the hole, 
frog, where are you? There wasn’t a frog popped out, a gopher popped out, 
and stuck him in the nose. The dog meanwhile was still busy with that 
beehive. Maybe frog was in there. Could that be? || The dog leaned against 
the tree and uh-oh! That beehive fell, and a bunch of angry buzzy bees came 
out || and started swarming toward the dog. The boy, meanwhile, continuing 
his look, looking for his frog || climbed up a tree and yelled into the 
hollow of a tree, frog? Where are you? There was no frog in the tree, and 
there was no frog in the hive. There were only bees in the hive and before 
you knew it all the bees were chasing the dog! The dog ran past the tree, 
the boy was startled by an owl that came out || of the tree and knocked the 
boy onto the ground. Poor dog, being stung, and the poor boy, falling on his 
back, and the owl, hooing. || The owl started chasing the boy and the boy 
was covering his head, and he ran up on a rock to grab onto some tree 
branches. The dog meanwhile was slinking around the rock. I think he’s lost 
all those bees. Boy still yelling as he holds onto the tree branches, frog, 
where are you? || The owl’s looking at the boy, the dog’s creeping around 
the rock, but then something really strange happens. || The tree branches 
start to move and before the boy knows it, he’s riding on the head of a 
deer. It wasn’t tree branches, it was the antlers of a deer. The dog is 
running with the deer, the deer is heading towards a cliff. What’s going to 
happen next? Uh-oh! The deer stops suddenly, the boy tumbles down, the dog 
tumbles down || down and down they go. || Plop! || They both land on top of 
one another in a pond. The boy sits up, the dog climbs on the— boy’s head, 
they look around, and of course, they hear something. What do you think they 
hear? I think maybe they hear the sound of a frog, croaking? The boy leans 
against a fallen log, he goes shhhh to the dog, so that they’re very very 
quiet. || They lean over the log... and I wonder what do they see on the 
other side of that log? [gasps] They see not one frog, they see two frogs! 
They see their pet frog, and then another frog. Oh it looks like maybe it’s 
his sweetheart. And it is. There’s a whole family of baby frogs. There’s a 
mama frog, a daddy frog, and lots of little baby frogs. The boy and the dog 
are so excited, one of the frogs is leaping right towards the little boy! 
The boy reaches out his hand and a little baby frog drops in it, and he 
waves to the mommy daddy frog, he waves to the other baby frogs, and off the 
boy, and the dog, and their new baby frog head for home. || The end.

So a boy had caught a frog and had placed him in a jar, which honestly does 
not seem like a good home for a frog. And yet the boy doesn’t care, he is 
just fascinated and so is his dog, Rufus, who seems to be trying to get the 
frog. The frog is very calm. So as the boy and Rufus sleep, the dog—I’m mean 
the frog, excuse me—crawls out and does seems to exhibit an extreme sense of 
flexibility and is able to get out of probably a life ending situation, 
because as I said a jar is not a great habitat for a frog. Froggy knows this 
and books it. So when…so the sun rises and the boy and the dog wake up and 
they notice that, well, the frog is gone. Of course the child is very upset 
about this and hurriedly looks all around his room to find the frog, in his 
boots and underneath the stool. Um, Rufus for some idiotic reason decides to 
poke his head in a see through jar even though well you know you can see the 
frog is not inside, Rufus. And oh look now Rufus has his head stuck in the 
jar while the boy is oblivious to Rufus’ distress, calling out to see where 
the frog is. Rufus, trying to get his attention, is going farther out the 
window and whoops, there he goes and smash. Now the boy gets out and gives 
his dog a hug and licks him lovingly, and the boy is probably like, “oh you 
scared me, jeeze,” so that’s why he looks quite mad. So they are out and 
about and they are looking and about to embark on a quest to find Froggy. So 
the boy looks down and tries to see if a frog is in this hole and sees nope, 
that’s a gopher. Rufus is barking at, uh, a bunch of bees it seems and it 
seems like he’s having a fun time. They boy looks at a really creepy kind of 
tree and Rufus seems to—oop, look at the mess Rufus has got himself into 
now, made the hive drop and oop, there they go trying to get their revenge, 
I can’t say that I blame them. Alright so now the boy is crawling up to get 
on the high ground to see if he can find the frog and he’s resting, holding 
onto some branches when it turns out that those are not branches, that is a 
buck and that buck seems to not really appreciate it when you manhandle his 
antlers. So he throws the boy and Rufus off of a cliff and into a pond, 
which seems rather harsh if you ask me. Good thing there was water there. 
Anyway he seems fine and now they’re in there and I swear an alligator is 
going to pop out because that seems to be keeping to the theme. Oh I see so 
he’s now going to investigate this log, because everything else that he has 
investigated has ended in him finding the frog and not some other creature 
that has caused him bodily harm. So he tells Rufus to be quiet and they peer 
over and oop, there they find a frog and ooh, the frog has a girlfriend and 
some little babies. And yeah so they’re adorable. Rufus looks really 
confused and the boy looks really happy. Anyway now they…wait are you 
serious? The boy is walking off with one of the frogs! And the parents and 
the rest of the family are just sitting there! And Rufus is eyeing that frog 
with a huge smile thinking that he’s going to be his dinner tonight! This is 
horrible!

Once upon a time, there was a boy, a dog, and a frog. The boy’s name was 
Smog. Smog, Dog, and Frog were friends. But Frog was always the second class 
citizen of the bunch. While Smog and Dog enjoyed their time up in the lofty 
bed, Frog stayed in his jar. Smog and Dog were happy with this situation. 
But Frog? Well, we’ll see… One night, Smog and Dog, as usual, settled into 
their bed. “Good night, Dog!” said Smog. “And good night, Frog!” Smog said 
as well. Dog gave Smog a lick on the face. Frog looked through his jar. 
Night fell, and eventually, or rather sooner, rather than later, Smog and 
Dog were sleeping like logs. Frog, though he looked like he was asleep, 
cracked his eye open. The time was now. Frog slipped out of the jar, and 
into the night. || The next morning, at around ten AM, it was a summer 
morning after all, Smog and Dog stretched out, lazily, and decided to start 
their day. “Good morning, Dog!” said Smog. Smog l—Dog licked Smog happily. 
Now, Smog turned to greet Frog as well. “Good morning, Fro—” … Smog stopped, 
mid-sentence. To his shock, and to Dog’s shock as well, the jar was empty! 
The morning light illuminated the emptiness of the jar. || Smog, afraid more 
than anything of what his mother would think, threw on a coat, and 
immediately started searching everywhere for Frog. “Frog, Frog!” Smog 
yelled. “Where are you?” Dog, for his part, stuck his nose, snout in the 
jar, sticking his neck inside, and sniffed around anywhere. He, too, could 
notice something was awry. || Opening the cracked window a little further, 
Smog and Dog leaned out. “Smog!” Or, “Frog!” Smog cried. “Frog!” But Frog 
was nowhere to be found. Dog, for his part, pawed the air, waiting 
expectantly for Frog’s response. But alas, there was none. || Dog, as he 
pawed, lost his balance. And, to Smog and Dog’s fright, Dog smashed to the 
floor with a big, bang! Broken pieces of the jar lay everywhere. Smog… 
jumped down as well, and, with a look of anger, picked up Dog. Though he 
looked angry, he was relieved more than anything. It could have ended up 
much more for Dog, and he wasn’t about to lose two pets that day. Dog, 
sheepishly, licked his friend, Smog. “Don’t you ever worry me like that 
again, Dog!” Smog yelled. But he was happy. || The two continued their 
search for the missing frog. “Frog! Frog!” Smog yelled, out into the 
afternoon. Or rather, the noontime. Bees buzzed out of the nearby hives, as 
Dog sniffed the air, searching for signs of his missing friend. “Frog!” 
yelled Smog again. But there was no response. || Eventually, Smog came upon 
a hole in the ground. “Are you down there, Frog?” cried Smog. “Are you down 
there, where it seems like your jar?” Dog, meanwhile, was getting tired of 
this whole ‘looking for frog’ thing and forgot about him entirely. Hearing 
the buzzes of the bees above, Dog barked excitedly. The bees… were not so 
happy about this occurrence. Meanwhile, a gopher emerged from the hole that 
Smog had thought held Frog. “Ooh!” yelled Fro—Smog. For the gopher had not 
just popped out, but had given a nibble on the nose as well. “Bad gopher!” 
Smog yelled. Dog, excited by the commotion, started beating at the tree with 
the beehive as well, howling, like Smog howled at the gopher. The bees were 
none too happy with this development. || Smog continued onward towards the 
next available hole, a knot in the tree. “Perhaps you’re in here, Frog,” 
said Smog. “Frog, Frog!” Meanwhile, dog had just come to terms with the 
consequences of his yapping, for the beehive, with a crash, had come to the 
forest floor, and the bees were out for revenge. In a… in a fever, and in a 
swarm, they came at Dog, angrily. Ready to exact their revenge on the 
intruder. || Bzzzz! All at once, an owl came popping out of the hole that 
Smog had been searching in the tree. “Ouch!” yelled Smog as he was knocked 
by surprise by the beating wings of the large owl, angry at being disturbed 
in its dazed sleep. Smog fell with a lump to the, a thump to the forest 
floor. Just as Dog found himself chased, chased, by that angry swarm of 
bees. Dog ran for his life, for though he had never been stung before, he 
could tell that nothing good li, lied in this angry swarm of buzzing, angry 
creatures. || Smog and Dog had been separated. For Dog, in his fear, had run 
a ways into the forest. Smog, meanwhile, was more concerned with angry owl. 
They had both violated nature. Smog, looking up at the owl, “Stop it! Stop 
it!” he yelled. He climbed up onto a boulder in order to try and gain an 
upper ground and to face the owl, and to finally turn it away. His effort 
succeeded. The owl, not willing to deal with another predator on the, on the 
uh, food chain, who was able to get such high a position, retreated, instead 
observing from a far off tree. Dog, perhaps with a few bee stings to pay for 
his crime, slowly, sheepishly, crawled back to Smog, sniffing him out, in 
hope that his friend would not notice the consequences, of his angering the 
bees. || Dog sniffed around for the rocks, perhaps hoping to redeem himself 
by finding Frog among them. But suddenly, from behind the rock, popped what 
seemed to be twigs, but were in fact antlers! “Oh!” Smog yelled again in 
surprise. The deer emerged from behind the rocks and hoisted Smog on its 
head. His legs straddling the confused deer’s, uh, head, a new headdress 
along with the antlers, perhaps another sign of dominance. The deer, more 
than anything, was just shocked that a loud, screeching creature had landed 
upon its head, and blindly… with no idea as to where his tormenter appeared 
from, started running off. Dog as well was flushed out from behind the rock 
where he was looking for Frog. The deer galloped and galloped, and Dog ran 
and ran in front of him, hoping not again to be punished for searching too 
far into the woods. Meanwhile, Smog yelled, “Help, help! Help me Dog!” But 
there was nothing to be done. Smog was hoisted so far atop the deer’s head. 
|| “Oh!” Smog yelled. They had come to a cliff. The deer, its instincts 
kicking in, stopped just short of, of the long outcrop. And while he saved 
himself, Smog, the momentum carrying him, was hurtled forward into the lake 
below. “Oh!” Was this the end of Smog? Perhaps. The drop seemed far. Five, 
ten, fifty feet? Everything is hazy in a child’s imagination, but it 
certainly was a respectable distance down. Dog as well, having been chased 
all the way to the edge of the outcrop, tumbled over, together with his 
friend, and they both were reaching over, going towards an uncertain fate. 
|| Sploosh! Dog, and Smog, together, landed headfirst into the pond below. 
The deer looked on sheepishly, knowing that it had overthrown its tormenter, 
though he did not know the nature of it. Alas, it turns out, the drop was 
not as far as it might seem. And the water mostly absorbed the impact. Smog, 
after shaking off the water, poked his head out of the water. Dog rode atop 
his head. They were happy that they had survived the ordeal, though perhaps 
Smog had suffered a mild concussion but didn’t realize it. For he found 
himself waving to a log, thinking that this was the deer. “Oh, Deer,” he 
said, “What a silly goose.” The log, being inanimate, failed to respond. || 
“Shhh! Dog, be quiet!” Smog said to Dog. “We don’t want to make Mr. Deer 
angry again!” He was still woozy from the drop. Dog, meanwhile, had not 
suffered any inhibitions to his cognition, and looked on sheepishly, not 
really understanding the intent. Dog and Smog, together, crawled over this 
log, in the pond, and, hoisting it, Dog went ahead, hoping finally to be the 
source of, uh, success for his master, rather than a failure. An early 
warning system, and fulfill his role as man’s best firend. Smog vaulte 
together with him over the top of the log. || Smog and Dog! Suddenly, 
noticed, and found what they were looking for! They hd found their friend 
Frog! Though they had forgotten minutes ago in the chaos of the bees and the 
owl and the deer, they once again immediately came to and realized what they 
were looking for all along. Dog sniffed and sniffed expectantly. And in 
fact, his nose was not lying. There was Frog. But not just Frog, but a 
little Frog Friend too! Smog and Frog, or Smog and Dog, looked on happily to 
Frog and his new Frog Friend. “We found Frog!” said Smog. “And a little Frog 
Friend too!” But not just a little Frog Friend, but a whole bunch of little 
tiny Frog Friends! The Dog was confused. He had never encountered little 
Frogs before. He raised his ears up in confusion. ‘A whole pack of Frogs? 
Will these Frogs band together and supplant me as alpha pet?’ Smog, on the 
other hand, completely understood what had happened. A Frog family! Frog had 
found Frogette. And together, they had founded a little Frog colony, behind 
the wood, in the pond. “Oh, Dog,” Smog said. “This is fantastic!” Smog and 
Dog continued on their way. They understood that Frog had found a new life. 
And that together with Frogette, they were prepared to raise a family. Frog, 
previously a second class citizen in the household, was now a patriarch, or 
rather, the … head, or, the co-parent, of his new Frog household. “I 
understand, Frog,” Smog said, like an empty nester, like an old baby boomer 
seeing his children off to college. “I understand, Frog, you found your own 
way now. But,” Smog said, with a mischievous little grin, “You must pay the 
price as well.” Smog, though Frog was not very happy, took his tax. He 
conscripted a new Frog to act as House Frog, to continue the line of 
second-class Frogs inhabiting the household. Dog, mostly, was happy, happy 
first of all that not all the Frogs would be coming back in order to 
supplant his role as pet, and happy as well to have a new Frog to act as a 
pet on the tier below him. Happy again, that he would be able to harass 
Frog, and act as head dog in the house. “Good bye, Frog!” Smog cried. “I’ll 
be coming back if this Frog dies.” Frog looked on, hoping that his family 
would not be decimated any further. And that is the story, of Frog, Where 
Are You? And The Finding of Frog. Together, Frog and Dog, and Frog, or 
rather, Smog, had learned their lesson. There’s no escaping second-class 
citizenship as House Frog.

Once upon a time there was a boy who lived with his dog and his frog. One 
night, when the boy was asleep, the frog escaped from his bottle. The next 
morning, the boy found the frog gone, and he was so sad. He looked 
everywhere in the house and didn’t find the frog. He called for the frog 
through the window and no one answers. Dog was trying so hard to call for 
the frog that || he fell off the…the window and almost hurt himself. Then 
the boy and the dog get out, eh, got out of the house to look for the frog 
in the forest. They looked in the ground hole and honeycomb, only to annoy 
the…[goofer?] and the bees. The boy looked into a tree hole only to find a 
owl. The boy looked into the bush only to find a buck. The buck carries the 
boy to a pond and dropped him into the water. || he was…all wet, but 
suddenly he heard something. The boy approached the wood quietly, would that 
be my frog? The boy looked behind the look…the wood, and, there it is, the 
frog and his wife, and a lot of frog babies. The boy said goodbye to the 
frog family and went home with one of their babies (laughter). Oh my god 
that’s so creepy (laughter).

This is my story of the…boy and the frog. So there was this boy, pernicious 
boy, evil boy, and his little toady dog who hung out with him. And all they 
did with their spare time was antagonize animals, especially amphibians, 
about whom they were not ambivalent, but were actually very 
very…aggressively against. They did not like frogs they, they did not want 
frogs to reproduce, they did not want frogs to think about being anything 
other than frogs, especially princes and whatnot. So the boy of course finds 
a frog and imprisons him in a bell jar and tortures him, tortures him, with 
the little toady of a dog, and he would say to himself all the time, “Where 
are you frog, where are you frog?” And he was just teasing him of course 
because the frog knew exactly where he was: he was in a bell jar in the 
boy’s bedroom instead of out in the woods frolicking with the other animals. 
And of course the little toady of the dog would sit there and stand watch 
over the frog all the day long to try to keep the frog imprisoned in this 
bell jar. One night the dog fell asleep, the little toad, he fell asleep and 
the frog escaped, leapt out of the bell jar and ran for the hills. The boy, 
thinking the frog not too clever of course because he was an anti-froggist, 
started to look around. The dog being even less clever put the stupid bell 
jar on his head and started to whine into it like, “Oh no, woe is me, I’m 
the one who lost the frog,” and almost killed himself by falling out the 
winder, breaking the bell jar around his head but thankfully not being hurt 
according to the boy, but all of us know that if he had cut his little 
jugular vein the frogs and all the other animals in the forest would have 
been much happier. So the boy and the dog go hunting back for this frog, not 
ones to be taken advantage of, and they come across all sorts of animals. 
Now what has happened actually is the frog has run around saying you know 
what I’m going to be making a break for it and there is going to be some boy 
and his little toady dog coming to find me, so what I really need is a 
little air cover over here. So all the animals banded together and said you 
know this is it, we’re going to attack you, you stupid boy, pernicious child 
and your little toady dog. So the bees attack him and the…whatever this 
thing is, I would say it might be a nutria, the nutria come out of the 
ground to attack him. He’s running through the forest and bees are biting at 
their legs and fighting the dog off and making sure that the boy is being 
attacked. The owl, the wisest of the animals, also leaps out and starts 
attacking the boy. No one is…everyone is trying to keep him from seeing the 
frog and finally the emperor stag of the forest knocks the boy off of a 
cliff and just says, “Get out of here you pernicious frog stealing boy.” 
There they tumbled to the bottom of the hill and are staying in a swamp. The 
boy has this completely ridiculous devotion to the dog who seems to have 
turned his back on the entire animal kingdom, except for humans of course, 
and they manage to get themselves behind the log where they hear, obviously, 
two frogs a courtin’. And this is again against everything….this is what the 
boy is against, he has no desire to see these two frogs make any more frogs 
and finds them and decides to take back the frog. And he stands holding the 
frog in his hand, shaking his fist at the rest of the animal kingdom saying, 
“I have retrieved my frog and I’m taking him home to his bell jar where he 
is going to live for the rest of his life without his beautiful frog 
paramour.” The end.

Frog, Where Are You? part one So, there was this boy named Max, and his dog, 
named Max and ** 
um and they were able to catch a frog um but on a side note, the dog was 
also named Junior, because it was younger, so we'll call the dog Junior and 
the dog was really intrigued and really wanted to smell it and the frog I I 
looked ok kinda cool then one night, as they were sleeping, the frog was 
able to get out and sneak out of the window because the window had been 
cracked overnight and then when Max and Max Junior woke up they noticed that 
the frog was gone and it saddened them so they looked everywhere they looked 
in their boot they looked in the glass container they looked underneath the 
bed and then eventually they saw the window was cracked and so they looked 
outside the window and called out the name of the frog which had been I I I 
Green! and so they yelled Green! Green! and found nothing the dog went 
outside the window and Max went outside the window also and Max was very mad 
and really really wanted to fmd his pet frog and so they went out to the 
forest and yelled, uh, Green! Green! Where are you? And they found the 
forest and they ran across a I I bee-hive

Ah yes once upon a time at night in a middle class household lived a boy 
named Stanley Stanley really enjoyed plaid patterns as evidenced by his 
pajamas one day after I I collecting I I things that he would collect with 
his pet dog Scruff who looks like it's a Dachshund they had found a frog, 
apparently, in the woods and they put it in a jar like any good child would 
do and brought it to their house which makes sense and since we haven't met 
Stanley's mother this probably worked ok so anyway, after a long day of high 
jinx and frog collecting et cetera Stanley went to sleep, Scruff sleeping at 
his feet meanwhile, the frog, who has no name, because it was night and 
apparently frogs do things at night snuck out of Stanley's room jumped out 
the window and when Stanley awoke the next morning the frog was gone that 
meant, a search must begin so Stanley and Scruff began searching through 
their room Scruff, trying to be helpful, quickly got his face stuck in the 
frog's jar that they had stored the frog in overnight meanwhile Stanley 
overturned all of his patterned clothes and boots trying to find the frog he 
did not succeed
